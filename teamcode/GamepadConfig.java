 * GamepadConfig.java
 *
 * STUDENT GUIDE: Gamepad Input Abstraction & Edge Detection
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * This class wraps the FTC SDK's Gamepad class to provide clean, reusable
 * access to a single controller's sticks and buttons. It only exposes raw
 * input - it doesn't know or care what those inputs will be used for.
 * Wire buttons to specific actions in your OpMode, not here.
 *
 * BUTTON BASICS:
 * - Every button method here is EDGE-DETECTED: it returns true only on the
 *   ONE loop cycle where the button transitions from released to pressed
 * - Holding the button down does NOT keep returning true every cycle
 * - This guards against a single physical press accidentally triggering an
 *   action dozens of times (the OpMode loop runs far faster than a human
 *   can release a button)
 *
 * STICK BASICS:
 * - Sticks return a continuous decimal value, not true/false
 * - Range is -1.0 to 1.0
 * - Raw FTC sticks report "up" as negative - we flip the sign so pushing
 *   the stick up returns a positive value (more intuitive)
 *
 * FTC SDK CONCEPTS:
 * - Gamepad: FTC SDK's raw controller object (gamepad1/gamepad2 in OpMode)
 * - Button fields (gamepad.a, gamepad.dpad_up, etc.): true/false, read
 *   fresh every time you access them - the SDK itself does NOT debounce
 * - Stick fields (gamepad.left_stick_y, etc.): -1.0 to 1.0 analog values

     * NEGATIVE and pushing DOWN reports POSITIVE - backwards from what

     * FTC SDK DETAIL:
     * gamepad.a is the SDK's raw, undebounced button state (true while

     * exact moment it was newly pressed, then remember today's state for
     * next cycle's comparison.
     *
     * STUDENT LEARNING:
     * This is EDGE DETECTION - detecting a state TRANSITION, not just a
     * state. Without it, holding A down for half a second (which is many
     * loop cycles) would trigger your action dozens of times instead of
     * once.
     *
